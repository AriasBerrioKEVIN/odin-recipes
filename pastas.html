    <p>What could be more Italian than a plate of spaghetti Bolognese? Even though it's a classic dish, it's not always easy to get it just right, like they do in Italy. That's why we're sharing this recipe, to help you create a dish that tastes like it came straight from a restaurant on Naples' Mergellina promenade.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>pasta</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
        <li>Ground meat</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Olive oil (or your preferred oil)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Let's talk about making this delicious dish</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>To start the Bolognese sauce, heat a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil in a pot over medium heat. Add a peeled and sliced clove of garlic and cook until fragrant. Then, add finely chopped onion and sauté until softened.</li>
        <li>Once the onion has softened and turned a light brown, add the crushed tomatoes and reduce the heat to low. Simmer gently for a couple of minutes, then add salt to taste, a tablespoon of sugar to balance the acidity of the tomatoes, and a pinch of oregano and parsley. Stir well and let the tomatoes simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix the ground meat with the juice of half a lemon. Season with a pinch of parsley and salt. Heat some extra virgin olive oil in a frying pan. When it's hot, add the meat and cook until it's browned but not fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Transfer the browned meat to the pot with the tomato sauce and let it simmer until cooked through.</li>
        <li>While the sauce simmers, cook the spaghetti in a large pot of boiling salted water. Drain the spaghetti when it's al dente and add it to the Bolognese sauce. Toss to coat the pasta with the flavorful sauce.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>To serve, sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil, if desired. This authentic pasta dish will be a hit with everyone at the table!</p>
    <p><strong>A little tip from a pasta lover:</strong> In Spain, people tend to cook pasta a bit longer than they do in Italy. To get that perfect "al dente" texture, cook the pasta for the exact amount of time indicated on the package. This will ensure the pasta is slightly firm, just like they do in Italy. </p>
