    <h4>And what are the ingredients?</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of fresh shrimp.</li>
        <li>1 onion and garlic.</li>
        <li>1 cup of cilantro.</li>

        <li>Let it sit for about two minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the shrimp while adding the onion, garlic, cilantro, and finally, of course, the shrimp, lemon juice, and tomato sauce in a glass bowl.</li>
