    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the ingredients</li>
        <p>Wash and rinse the pork or chicken bones with cold water to remove impurities. Cut the onion in half, the carrots into large pieces, and the ginger into slices. Peel and cut the head of garlic in half. Finely chop the green onions. Boil the eggs for 7 minutes, cool them, peel them, and marinate them in a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, and water (in equal parts) for at least 1 hour.</p>
        <li>Cook the broth</li>
        <p>In a large pot, add the pork or chicken bones, onion, garlic, ginger, carrots, and kombu seaweed (if using). Add 2 liters of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for at least 4 hours. Then, add 100 ml of soy sauce, 50 ml of mirin, and salt to taste. Cook for another 30 minutes. Strain the broth and keep it warm.</p>
        <li>Cook the noodles</li>
        <p>Boil the ramen noodles according to the package instructions. Once cooked, drain them and rinse them with cold water to stop the cooking. Divide the noodles among the four bowls.</li>
            <li>Prepare the pork</li>
        <p>If you didn't buy the pork ready, roast a piece of pork belly with soy sauce, sugar, sake, and water over low heat until tender. Then, slice the chashu thinly.</p>
        <li>Prepare the toppings</li>
        <p>Cut the bamboo shoots into strips, finely chop the green onions, and cut the nori sheets into strips. If desired, cook some sweet corn to add to the ramen.</p>
        <li>Assemble the ramen</li>
        <p>Pour the hot broth over the noodles in each bowl. Carefully place the marinated eggs cut in half, the slices of chashu, the bamboo shoots, the sweet corn (if using), and the chopped green onions on top of the noodles. Add a nori sheet to each bowl and, if desired, a drizzle of sesame oil.</p>
        <li>serve</li>
